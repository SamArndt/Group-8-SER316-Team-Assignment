On their first trip to Berlin, Julia landed at the Flughafen feeling both excited and hungry.
Outfitted in Lederhose, they knew there was only one logical choice for their next stop: the closest Biergarten.
They rented a BMW and picked up their friend from their Baeckerei along their way.
The duo cruised down Hauptstrasse, singing along to a Rammstein song that was playing on the car radio.
Craving something sweet, they stopped for a slice of Apfelkuchen before continuing their adventure.
As they left the shop, slightly wishing it was Bratwurst they had purchased instead, a loud crashing noise from a nearby Schloss penetrated their skulls.
When the turned their heads, they saw that a Poursche had just crashed.
A man in a Dirdndl ran outside, shouting about lost crates of Brot and Geback meant for a Ratskeller nearby.
Outfitted in Lederhose as they were, they offered to help turn the lost Brot and Geback into Doener.
They realized that this man was actually the owner of the famous Eltz Castle; touched by their generous offer, he invited them on a private tour of his ancestral home.
