On their first trip to Berlin, Julia landed at the Flughafen feeling both excited and hungry.
Outfitted in Lederhose, they knew there was only one logical choice for their next stop: the closest Biergarten.
They rented a BMW and picked up their friend from their Baeckerei along their way.
The duo cruised down Hauptstrasse, singing along to a Rammstein song that was playing on the car radio.
Craving something sweet, they stopped for a slice of Apfelkuchen before continuing their adventure.
As they left the shop, slightly wishing it was Bratwurst they had purchased instead, a loud crashing noise from a nearby Schloss penetrated their skulls.
When the turned their heads, they saw that a Poursche had just crashed.
A man in a Dirdndl ran outside, shouting about lost crates of Brot and Geback meant for a Ratskeller nearby.
Outfitted in Lederhose as they were, they offered to help turn the lost Brot and Geback into Doener.
Being exceptionally wettbewerbsfaehig, they decided to make it a contest with the ratskeller- who can whip up the most delicious doener?
After eating the Doener, they decided to check out Schloss Eltz.
Upon arriving at the Ratskeller, everyone realized they actually wanted some Apfelkuchen so they took a trip to the Schloss.
Outfitted in Lederhose as they were, they offered to help turn the lost Brot and Geback into Doener.
In the distance, they saw a hund running away from a b√§ckerei with a slice of brot in it's mouth - the owner chasing after it with a rolling pin.
